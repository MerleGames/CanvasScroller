Simple Canvas Scroller example. New panels, which contains buttons ( but can be replaced with anything else ) are manually added under ScrollPanel, and manually drag and dropped into the script on the ScrollManager, or the ScrollManagerInfinite.

Two scenes, CanvasScroller and CanvasScrollerInfinite contain examples of canvas scrolling for a set number of elements, the 'infinite' example showcases how to 'wrap' the scrollable area.
